## ZzSprite-Godot
A port of ZzSprite (A Tiny Sprite Generator) by Frank Force to Godot

### Details
- ~~Requires Mono Version of Godot due to the requirement for 32bit Integers (for the ZzSpriteLibs.cs)~~ Now 100% GDScript!
- ~~Colors aren't quite the same~~ Properly converting HSL to HSV!
- ~~Only the main ZzSprite script is ported, none of the settings or options. (same things still possible,# just with editing the parameters for the ZzSprite function)~~ Options ported to export variables in the editor!
- Seeds from the web version of ZzSprite are **100% compatible** with the godot port!
