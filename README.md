## ZzSprite-Godot
A port of ZzSprite (A Tiny Sprite Generator) by Frank Force to Godot

### Details
- Requires Mono Version of Godot due to the requirement for 32bit Integers (for the ZzSpriteLibs.cs)
- Colors aren't quite the same
- Only the main ZzSprite script is ported, none of the settings or options. (same things still possible, just with editing the parameters for the ZzSprite function)
- Seeds from the web version of ZzSprite are compatible with the godot port
